## For classifying product names to categories: What precision (P@1) were you able to achieve?
P@1     0.966
## For classifying product names to categories: What fastText parameters did you use?
-epoch 25 -lr 1.0 -wordNgrams 2
## For classifying product names to categories: How did you transform the product names?
I noticed that `transform()` function was noop and added `strip()` and `lower()` thereto. This, however, is redundant in case of normalization using `sed`.
## For classifying product names to categories: How did you prune infrequent category labels, and how did that affect your precision?
By only including categories with more than 500 products. It improved P@1 from 0.655 to 0.966.
